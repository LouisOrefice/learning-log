# 18-05-24 - Beginner/tutorial Course

I have started to create Github learning logs to document my learning journey and help reflect on what I learn each day. Im hoping to show my progression over the next few months.

## ‚úÖ What I Did Today

Coursea - Meta Front End Course

- Briefly went over OOP (Object Orientated Programming)
- Had a quick look at constructors and classes.
- Analyzed the importance of inheritance. - At first it was quite confusing but after breaking down the role of the constructor and its prototypes, it started to make more sense.
- Briefly covered default parameters.

- Today I organized this GitHub learning 'blog' to help reflect on my web development journey.

## üîç What I Learned

- Today I learned the importance of inheritance in OOP. The parent (constructor) object can share its properties and methods with its children (prototypes). The 'extends' tool provides the super element with the base element's properties. Plus when you alter the current super element, the other objects values do not alter. You can add new methods/behaviors in the prototypes. Overall the base element sets up other super elements. These super elements can then share their properties with other various objects.

-Default parameters enable quick testing in OOP as you don't have to use proper arguments. Fetching real test data make take too much time.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Practice basic JS problems on CodeWars.
- Look into making an asteroid game.
- Look into projects solved by OOP.
